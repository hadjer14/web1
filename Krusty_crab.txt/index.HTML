                A short story about a new employee at the Krusty Krab

                Patchy the Pirate had always dreamed of working at the Krusty Krab. When he finally got the job, he was over the moon. But the reality of working at the Krusty Krab was far different from what he had imagined. Mr. Krabs was a penny-pinching boss, SpongeBob was a bit too enthusiastic, and Squidward was downright miserable. Patchy soon realized that working at the Krusty Krab was not all it was cracked up to be.
